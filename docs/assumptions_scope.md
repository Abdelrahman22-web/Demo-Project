## Assumptions & Scope

### Assumptions
- You want a reusable Markdown section you can paste into an assignment/report.
- “Assumptions & scope” should be written in a neutral, project-documentation tone.
- The section should be general-purpose (not tied to a specific project domain) unless you later swap in project-specific details.
- The audience is classmates/instructors/teammates who need clarity on what was (and wasn’t) considered.

### In Scope
- Clear statement of what the document/work covers (features, goals, boundaries).
- Constraints and dependencies that affect the work (time, tools, data, environment).
- Definitions of key terms if needed.
- Explicit assumptions used to make decisions when requirements are incomplete.
- What success looks like (high-level acceptance criteria).

### Out of Scope
- Features or requirements not explicitly included in the stated goals.
- Long-term scalability/enterprise concerns unless stated as a requirement.
- Edge cases or integrations not supported by the chosen tools/constraints.
- Production deployment, monitoring, and compliance work unless explicitly included.
- Ongoing maintenance after delivery unless explicitly included.

### Constraints
- Timeline: limited to the course/project deadline window.
- Resources: small team / limited compute and budget.
- Environment: runs on the specified OS/runtime/toolchain for the project.
- Data: uses only the provided or permitted datasets/inputs.

### Risks & Unknowns
- Requirements may evolve; assumptions may need revision.
- External services/APIs (if any) may change behavior or rate limits.
- Testing coverage may be bounded by time and access to real users/data.

### Change Control
- If a requirement conflicts with an assumption, the requirement wins.
- Any assumption changes will be documented with date + reason.
